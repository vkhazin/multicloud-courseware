# Cloud Infrastructure

* Predominantly API-driven
* May scale up/out to handle a load during a peak day,
* Better scale down/in at night to save on cost
* Much higher elasticity of infrastructure
* Numerous smaller instances
* Many more things to provision
* Infrastructure tends to be cyclic and/or ephemeral
* The scale and churn of infrastructure is much, much higher
* How do I automate?
