# Native vs. 3rd Party Monitoring

* Cloud providers focus on their own stack and objectives
* Monitoring other cloud provider assets is lesser of a priority
* Some cloud providers offer tools for a hybrid cloud monitoring
* Ease of setup is secondary for a cloud-native tool
* Lock-in for cloud-native tools is a norm
* For a 3rd party provider, seamless integration with many providers is a competitive advantage
* 3rd party provider focus is multi-cloud and on-premises
* What's easier to switch a monitoring provider or a cloud provider?
