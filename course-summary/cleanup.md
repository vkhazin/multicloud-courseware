# Cleanup

* GCP: delete the projects created during the course
* Azure: delete the resource groups created during the course, delete the storage account created for the online shell
* Aws: delete EC2 instances and delete Cloud9 environment created for online IDE, check all the regions used
* JumpCloud, Pcf, and DataDog: you can delete the accounts if you have no further plans using them
* Optionally, delete Aws, Azure, and GCP accounts as well to void a potential hijacking of an account
* Should you decide to keep the Aws/Azure/GCP accounts, make sure to enable MFA to prevent hijacking of the account
